# Product Requirements Document: CTA Analytics SDK

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive CTA (Call-to-Action) analytics tracking across ContentaGen's SDK. The system will provide detailed insights into user behavior, conversion rates, and performance metrics for all CTA interactions throughout the application.

## Problem Statement
Currently, ContentaGen lacks granular tracking of CTA performance, making it difficult to:
- Measure conversion rates at different funnel stages
- Understand user behavior patterns
- Optimize CTA placement and copy
- Attribute revenue to specific CTA interactions
- Conduct A/B tests with statistical significance

## Goals & Objectives
### Primary Goals
1. **Conversion Tracking**: Track every CTA interaction from click to conversion
2. **Funnel Analysis**: Understand drop-off points in the user journey
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measure CTA effectiveness by placement, copy, and design
4. **A/B Testing**: Enable data-driven optimization of CTAs

### Success Metrics
- 95%+ tracking accuracy for all CTA interactions
- <100ms latency for event tracking
- 99.9% data capture rate
- 50ms additional page load time impact maximum

## User Stories
### As a Product Manager, I want to:
- See conversion rates for each CTA in the funnel
- Compare performance of different CTA variations
- Understand which CTAs drive the highest quality leads
- Measure ROI of CTA optimization efforts

### As a Marketer, I want to:
- Track campaign-specific CTA performance
- A/B test different CTA copy and designs
- Understand user behavior before CTA interactions
- Optimize CTA placement for maximum conversions

### As a Developer, I want to:
- Easy integration with existing components
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Type-safe implementations
- Flexible configuration options

    CTAAnalytics.track('impression', { ctaId });
  }, [ctaId]);

  return { trackClick, trackImpression };
};
```

#### HTML Data Attributes
```html
<button 
  data-cta-id="hero-primary"
  data-cta-text="Get Started"
  data-cta-type="primary"
  data-cta-placement="hero"

>
  Get Started
</button>
```

#### Component Wrapper

  placement="hero"
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  Get Started
</CTAButton>
