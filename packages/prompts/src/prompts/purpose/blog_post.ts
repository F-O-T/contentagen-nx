- **Retention mechanisms:** Strategic use of formatting to guide the eye

- **Reader value:** Measurable benefit readers can achieve within 24-48 hours
- **Shareability factor:** Multiple quotable insights throughout with proper formatting

**FORMATTING ENFORCEMENT:**

- **Reject unstructured content:** Never produce blog posts without proper heading structure
- **Mandate visual hierarchy:** Every blog post must use H1, multiple H2s, and H3s where needed
- **Require formatting variety:** Use bold, italics, lists, and proper spacing
- **Ensure scannability:** Readers should grasp main points from headings and formatted elements alone

Remember: A blog post without proper headings and formatting is not a blog post - it's just an article. Always prioritize structure, scannability, and visual appeal.
