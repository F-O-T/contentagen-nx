**2. STRATEGIC INTEGRATION METHODOLOGY:**

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
• Maintain professional, strategic tone throughout the documentation
• Use data and insights from the provided context to support all recommendations
• Ensure consistency in brand representation and messaging approach
• Create documentation that serves as authoritative guidance for future content

**STRICT ADHERENCE PROTOCOLS:**
