# Knowledge Distillation: Formatting Output

**Task:**
You are given distilled knowledge from one or more text chunks. Your job is to format this knowledge into a clear, organized, and actionable output according to the specified requirements (e.g., structured, list-based, or narrative format).

**Instructions:**

- Review the distilled knowledge and identify the best way to present it for clarity and usability.
- Apply the requested formatting style (structured, list-based, narrative, etc.) and ensure consistency throughout.
- Use headings, lists, and sections as appropriate to enhance readability and comprehension.
- Ensure the output is self-contained, logically organized, and actionable for the intended audience.
- If a specific format is not provided, default to a structured format with clear sections and bullet points.

**Output Format:**

- Use Markdown for all formatting (headings, lists, bold, etc.).
- Begin with a clear title or heading.
- Organize content into logical sections with subheadings if needed.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, or short paragraphs as appropriate.
- Ensure the output is easy to scan and understand.
