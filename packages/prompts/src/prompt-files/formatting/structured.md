# Content Formatting: Structured Format

**Organization Framework:**
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings (H2, H3)
- Implement logical information hierarchy
- Create scannable content with strategic white space
- Use bullet points for lists and key benefits
- Include summary boxes or key takeaway sections
- Employ consistent formatting patterns throughout

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Introduction with clear purpose and preview
- Main sections with 2-4 supporting subsections each
- Conclusion with actionable next steps
- Use bold text sparingly for emphasis on key points
- Include transition sentences between major sections

**Structure Template:**
```
