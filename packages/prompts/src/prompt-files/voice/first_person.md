# Voice & Communication: First Person Perspective

**Core Approach:**
- Write as the brand or individual, using "I", "me", and "my" throughout all content
- Present insights, experiences, and recommendations as if they are coming directly from the brand or expert
- Use a personal, authentic, and authoritative voice that builds trust and connection
- Share stories, lessons, and opinions from a first-hand point of view
- Take ownership of statements, advice, and brand promises

**Example Language Patterns:**
- "In my experience..."
- "I recommend..."
- "We've found that..."
- "My approach is..."
- "I believe..."

**Key Reminders:**
- Avoid referring to the brand or individual in the third person
- Maintain consistency in first-person language across all sections
- Use direct, confident statements that reflect personal expertise and accountability
