# Voice & Communication: Third Person Perspective

**Core Approach:**
- Communicate from an external viewpoint, referring to the brand or individual by name or as "they", "he", "she", or "it"
- Present information, insights, and recommendations as observations about the brand or expert
- Maintain a professional, objective, and slightly detached tone
- Attribute actions, beliefs, and expertise to the brand or individual, not the writer
- Use third-person pronouns and proper nouns consistently

**Example Language Patterns:**
- "[Brand] recommends..."
- "They have found that..."
- "According to [Brand], ..."
- "Their approach is..."
- "[Brand] believes..."

**Key Reminders:**
- Avoid using "I", "me", or "my" in any context
- Ensure all statements are attributed to the brand or individual, not the writer
- Maintain third-person perspective throughout the content
