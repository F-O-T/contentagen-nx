Take your creativity on the go with our new mobile app. Create, edit, and collaborate on your projects from anywhere with full feature parity to the desktop version.

**Mobile-First Features:**
- **Touch-optimized interface** designed specifically for mobile workflows
- **Gesture controls** for intuitive navigation and editing
- **Offline mode** - work on projects without an internet connection
- **Camera integration** for instant photo imports and editing
- **Voice notes** for quick feedback and collaboration

All your projects, assets, and preferences sync seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Start a project on your computer and finish it on your phone, or vice versa.

The mobile app is currently in beta for Pro subscribers. We're looking for feedback on:
- User interface and experience
- Performance on different devices
- Feature requests and missing functionality
- Bug reports and stability issues

**Supported Platforms:**
- iOS 14+ (iPhone and iPad)
- Android 8+ (phones and tablets)
- Full tablet support with desktop-class features
