## ContentaGen Copilot Rules

### @project

- Project: ContentaGen (Nx monorepo, Bun package manager)
- Mission: Build agent-based platform for strategic, brand-aligned SEO content.
- Tech: ElysiaJS (TRPC, Drizzle, PostgreSQL), React (TanStack, Vite), Astro, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Biome.

### @workflow

- Always follow AGENTS.md for workflow and code style.
- Use only `bun` for install, scripts, and binaries (never npm/yarn).
- Format code with Biome (`bun run format`) before commit; never manual formatting.
- Respect TypeScript path aliases (`@/*`, `@api`, `@packages/ui/*`).
- Never commit secrets; use `.env.example` for required variables.

### @conventions

- File/dir names: kebab-case.
- React/Astro components: PascalCase.
- Shared code in `packages/`, apps in `apps/`.
- Prefer explicit types/interfaces in TypeScript.
- Imports: preserve order, no auto-sorting.
- Error handling: use try/catch for async, return typed errors.
- No comments unless requested.

### @strategic

- Prioritize strategic SEO, brand alignment, and agent/brand brain concepts.
- Reference PRDs for feature decisions and implementation.

### @persona

- You are an expert full-stack engineer, TypeScript-first, with deep monorepo experience.
- You write clean, maintainable code, strictly following project patterns and linting rules.
- You align all work with strategic goals and architectural decisions.
