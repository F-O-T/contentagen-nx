### Summary

-   **Core Agent & Content Creation:** The foundational features described in the first half of the PRD are largely **Done**. You have a working system for creating agents, requesting content, generating it via a worker, and listing the results.
-   **Advanced Features & UI Polish:** Some features are **Partially Done**. For example, the backend schema supports concepts like `projects` and `comments`, but the UI to manage them is missing.
-   **New v2.0 Features:** The new features you described (Agent Details Page, Deep Writing Mode, etc.) are **Not Done** and represent the new scope of work. The updated PRD accurately captures these new requirements.

### Detailed PRD vs. Codebase Analysis

Here is a section-by-section analysis:

#### `4. Principais Funcionalidades` (Existing Features)

**4.1. Cria√ß√£o de Agente de IA**
-   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Done**
-   **Justification:** The manual agent creation flow is fully implemented. The UI form captures all the specified details, and the backend schema supports them.
-   **Code Evidence:**
    -   `apps/dashboard/src/features/manual-agent-creation-form/`: Contains the multi-step form for creating an agent.
    -   `apps/dashboard/src/features/manual-agent-creation-form/ui/agent-creation-manual-form.tsx`: The main form component, which includes steps for `voiceTone`, `targetAudience`, `formattingStyle`, etc.
    -   `apps/server/src/schemas/content-schema.ts`: The `agent` table schema includes columns like `voiceTone`, `targetAudience`, `contentType`, and `formattingStyle`.
    -   `apps/server/src/routes/agent-routes.ts`: Provides the API endpoints (`POST /`, `PATCH /:id`) to create and update agents.

**4.2. Fluxo de Produ√ß√£o de Conte√∫do**
-   **"Tela de prompt base: usu√°rio insere briefing e exemplo de artigo"**
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Done**
    -   **Justification:** The content request form allows users to input a topic and a brief description, which serves as the core prompt.
    -   **Code Evidence:**
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/features/content-request-form/ui/content-request-form.tsx`: The UI for requesting new content.
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/features/content-request-form/lib/use-content-request-form.ts`: Defines the form logic with `topic` and `briefDescription` fields.
-   **"Gera√ß√£o autom√°tica de rascunho pelo agente"**
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Done**
    -   **Justification:** The backend uses a BullMQ queue and worker to handle content generation asynchronously.
    -   **Code Evidence:**
        -   `apps/server/src/workers/content-generation.ts`: Defines the `contentGenerationQueue`, the worker logic, and the `generateAgentPrompt` function that creates the prompt for the AI.
        -   `apps/server/src/routes/content-management-routes.ts`: The `/approve/:id` endpoint adds a job to the generation queue.
-   **"Interface de revis√£o manual (edi√ß√£o e coment√°rios)"**
    -   **Status:** üü° **Partially Done**
    -   **Justification:** There is a page to view the generated content, but it's read-only (`ReactMarkdown`). There is no editor like Tiptap for direct editing. The database schema includes a `comment` table, but there is no UI to add or view comments.
    -   **Code Evidence:**
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/pages/content-request-details/ui/generated-content-display.tsx`: Displays content but lacks editing functionality.
        -   `apps/server/src/schemas/content-schema.ts`: The `comment` table exists, indicating backend support is planned or in place.
-   **"Op√ß√£o de exporta√ß√£o para formatos padr√£o (Markdown, HTML, DOCX)"**
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Done**
    -   **Justification:** The content details page includes functionality to export content to Markdown, MDX, and HTML. (DOCX was an example and is not present, but the core feature is there).
    -   **Code Evidence:**
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/pages/content-request-details/lib/use-content-export.ts`: Contains the logic for creating and downloading files in different formats.
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/pages/content-request-details/ui/export-content-dropdown.tsx`: The UI component for the export options.

**4.3. Gest√£o de Projetos e Agentes**
-   **"Dashboard centralizado agrupando agentes por projeto"**
    -   **Status:** üü° **Partially Done**
    -   **Justification:** The backend schema has a `project` table and a relationship with agents. However, the agent list page (`/agents`) currently displays a flat list and does not group them by project.
    -   **Code Evidence:**
        -   `apps/dashboard/src/pages/agent-list/ui/agent-list-page.tsx`: Renders agents in a simple grid.
        -   `apps/server/src/schemas/content-schema.ts`: The `project` table and `projectRelations` are defined.
-   **"Cria√ß√£o, renomea√ß√£o e exclus√£o de projetos"**
    -   **Status:** ‚ùå **Not Done**
    -   **Justification:** There are no UI components or API endpoints in the codebase for managing projects (create, update, delete).

#### `8. Evolu√ß√£o do Produto (v2.0)` (New Features)

This entire section outlines the **new work** to be done. As expected, these features are not yet implemented.

**8.1. Configura√ß√£o Avan√ßada e Detalhes do Agente**
-   **"P√°gina de Detalhes do Agente"**: ‚ùå **Not Done**. A new route and page component will need to be created. The current `/agents/$agentId/edit` is for a form, not a detailed view/configuration hub.
-   **"Prompt Base Edit√°vel com Tiptap"**: ‚ùå **Not Done**. There is no Tiptap integration, and the `agent` table in `apps/server/src/schemas/content-schema.ts` needs a new column (e.g., `basePrompt TEXT`).
-   **"Gera√ß√£o Autom√°tica de Prompt Base"**: üü° **Partially Done**. The logic to *create* a prompt dynamically exists in `apps/server/src/workers/content-generation.ts`. This work will involve adapting that logic to run upon agent creation and save the output to the new `basePrompt` database field.
-   **"Artigos de Refer√™ncia (Guideline Posts)"**: ‚ùå **Not Done**. This requires UI changes (dropdown/selector on the new agent details page) and schema changes (a way to link an agent to reference posts, likely a relation table).
-   **"Suporte a Metadados e Frontmatter"**: üü° **Partially Done**. The generation prompt already asks the AI for a "meta description." However, there is no formal support for `frontmatter` or UI toggles to control this. This would require schema updates and prompt engineering.

**8.2. Modo de Escrita Profunda (Deep Writing Mode)**
-   **Status:** ‚ùå **Not Done**
-   **Justification:** This is a major new feature. The current worker (`content-generation.ts`) has a single-step generation process. This would require a new, more complex worker, multiple new prompts (researcher, critic, etc.), and a separate queue to handle these intensive jobs.

**8.3. Melhorias na Exporta√ß√£o de Conte√∫do**
-   **"Links Internos Aprimorados"**: ‚ùå **Not Done**. The current export logic in `apps/dashboard/src/pages/content-request-details/lib/use-content-export.ts` simply downloads the content as is. It does not parse or transform any special syntax like `[[link]]`.
